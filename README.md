# US-Elections-Program
This file explains the required format of the input file for the algorithm to work.

First of all, the first line of the input file contains a single integer that represents the number of states taken into account by a poll.

After that, each line contains respectively four integers (separated by spaces) with the following information:

	1- The number of delegates for a specific state.
	2- The number of people who will vote for Biden in that state.
	3- The number of people who will vote for Trump in that state.
	4- The number of people who have not made a voting decision in that state yet.
	
The program calculates the minimum number of people that Biden would have to convince to earn the US presidency. If it is not possible for Mr. Biden to win the election, the algorithm outputs the integer âˆ’1.
